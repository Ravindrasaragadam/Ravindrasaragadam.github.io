        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
                When I joined 6sense in early 2022, our B2B intelligence platform was processing data using Spark batch jobs. We'd ingest events, run batch transformations every 5-15 minutes, and update downstream systems. It worked. But there was a problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every time we needed to deploy a pipeline change, we had to pause all related pipelines. Why? Because Spark batch jobs needed a consistent state before committing changes. Any in-flight data could be lost or corrupted during deployment. This meant deployment windows, coordination overhead, and delayed features.
            </p>

            <p>
                We needed true real-time processing with better state management. That's when we made the switch to Apache Flink. Today, we process over 50,000 events per second with sub-second latency, and we can deploy without pausing pipelines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's what I learned making that transition, and how to decide which tool is right for your use case.
            </p>

            <h2>The Real Difference (It's Not What You Think)</h2>

            <p>
                Most articles will tell you "Flink is true streaming, Spark is micro-batching." That's technically true, but it misses the point. The real question is: <em>What does that difference mean for your actual use case?</em>
            </p>

            <h3>Spark Batch: The Foundation</h3>

            <p>
                Spark batch processing is powerful. You write transformations, execute them on massive datasets, and get results. Simple, reliable, battle-tested.
            </p>

            <p>
                At 6sense, we were using Spark batch for:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Aggregating user events into session data (every 5 minutes)</li>
                <li>Enriching incoming data with reference tables</li>
                <li>Feeding processed events into Elasticsearch</li>
                <li>Generating analytics for dashboards</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                It worked well for months. But as our event volume grew and product requirements evolved, pain points emerged.
            </p>

            <h3>The Batch Processing Problem</h3>

            <p>
                Our biggest challenge wasn't performance—it was <strong>deployment complexity</strong>:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>State consistency</strong>: Before deploying changes, we had to ensure all batches completed successfully</li>
                <li><strong>Pipeline dependencies</strong>: Multiple pipelines shared state. Updating one meant coordinating with others</li>
                <li><strong>Deployment windows</strong>: We needed 15-30 minute windows where we'd pause pipelines, deploy, then resume</li>
                <li><strong>Data latency</strong>: 5-15 minute processing intervals meant insights were always delayed</li>
                <li><strong>Resource waste</strong>: Clusters sat idle between batch runs, but we couldn't scale down</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>The Breaking Point:</strong> We wanted to implement real-time anomaly detection. With 5-minute batch intervals, we'd detect issues too late. Plus, every deployment meant coordinating across 8+ pipelines. We needed a better way.
            </div>

            <h2>Enter Apache Flink</h2>

            <p>
                Flink is built from the ground up for stream processing. Not batching disguised as streaming—actual event-by-event processing.
            </p>

            <h3>What Made Flink Different</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>1. True Event Time Processing</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Flink's event time handling is phenomenal. We could process late-arriving events correctly without complex workarounds. Watermarks gave us precise control over when to trigger computations.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>2. State Management</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Flink's state management is a game-changer. We maintain billions of state entries (tracking user sessions, intent signals, etc.) with minimal overhead. The state backend options (RocksDB for large state, heap for fast access) give you real flexibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>3. Exactly-Once Semantics</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Flink's two-phase commit protocol ensures exactly-once processing even across multiple sinks. No more worrying about duplicate events in downstream systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>4. Backpressure Handling</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                When downstream systems slow down, Flink's automatic backpressure prevents data loss and reduces the need for over-provisioning.
            </p>

            <h2>The Migration Journey</h2>

            <p>
                Migrating from Spark to Flink wasn't trivial. Here's what we learned:
            </p>

            <h3>Week 1-2: Learning Curve</h3>

            <p>
                Flink's API is different. If you're coming from Spark, expect an adjustment period. The DataStream API takes a different approach than Spark's DataFrame API.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Start with Flink's Table API if you're comfortable with SQL. It's similar to Spark SQL and easier to learn.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 3-4: State Management Strategy</h3>

            <p>
                This is where Flink shines but also where it gets complex. We had to rethink how we manage state:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Which state backend to use? (We went with RocksDB for large state)</li>
                <li>How to partition state effectively?</li>
                <li>What's our checkpoint interval? (We settled on 30 seconds)</li>
                <li>How to handle state schema evolution?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 5-6: Performance Tuning</h3>

            <p>
                Flink requires different tuning than Spark:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parallelism</strong>: We used 120 parallel instances for our main jobs</li>
                <li><strong>Network buffers</strong>: Increased to handle high throughput</li>
                <li><strong>Managed memory</strong>: Tuned for RocksDB state backend</li>
                <li><strong>Checkpointing</strong>: Found the sweet spot between frequency and overhead</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Use Spark Streaming</h2>

            <p>
                Don't get me wrong—Spark Streaming is still an excellent choice for many scenarios:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your latency SLA is 5+ seconds</strong>: No need for the complexity of Flink</li>
                <li><strong>You already use Spark for batch</strong>: Code reuse and unified architecture are valuable</li>
                <li><strong>Simple transformations and aggregations</strong>: Spark's SQL-like API makes this easy</li>
                <li><strong>Team expertise</strong>: If your team knows Spark well, the productivity gain matters</li>
                <li><strong>Integration requirements</strong>: Spark's ecosystem is bigger—more connectors, more libraries</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Use Flink</h2>

            <p>
                We chose Flink because:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sub-second latency requirements</strong>: Real-time matters for our use case</li>
                <li><strong>Complex stateful computations</strong>: User session tracking, pattern detection, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>High throughput with low latency</strong>: We need both, not one or the other</li>
                <li><strong>Event time processing</strong>: Handling out-of-order events correctly is critical</li>
                <li><strong>Complex event processing</strong>: Pattern matching and sequence detection</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Results at 6sense</h2>

            <p>
                After migrating from Spark batch to Flink streaming:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reduced average latency from 5-15 minutes to under 1 second</li>
                <li>Eliminated deployment coordination—we can now deploy without pausing pipelines</li>
                <li>Scaled to 50K+ events/second with predictable performance</li>
                <li>Enabled real-time features that were impossible with batch processing</li>
                <li>Reduced infrastructure costs by 15% through better resource utilization</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                But it wasn't all wins. We also:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Spent 6 weeks on the migration and learning curve</li>
                <li>Had to build custom monitoring and alerting for Flink-specific metrics</li>
                <li>Invested in training the team on Flink's concepts</li>
                <li>Dealt with a smaller community and fewer Stack Overflow answers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Recommendation</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Start with Spark Batch if:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your latency requirements are measured in minutes or hours</li>
                <li>You process data on a schedule (hourly, daily)</li>
                <li>You already have Spark expertise in your team</li>
                <li>Deployment complexity isn't a major concern</li>
                <li>Your data volume is large but arrival rate is predictable</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Choose Flink Streaming if:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>You need true low-latency processing (seconds or sub-second)</li>
                <li>You want zero-downtime deployments with stateful processing</li>
                <li>You're doing complex stateful computations across time windows</li>
                <li>You need exactly-once processing semantics</li>
                <li>You're willing to invest in learning a new framework</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>The Truth:</strong> Both tools are excellent. Flink isn't "better" than Spark Streaming—it's different. The question isn't which is superior, but which better matches your requirements, constraints, and team capabilities.
            </div>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

            <p>
                The move to Flink was the right choice for 6sense. But it wasn't an easy choice, and it wasn't cheap in terms of time and effort.
            </p>

            <p>
                If I were starting a new streaming project today, I'd ask myself:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>What's my actual latency requirement? (Be honest—do you really need sub-second?)</li>
                <li>How complex is my state management?</li>
                <li>What does my team already know?</li>
                <li>What's the cost of being wrong? (Can I migrate later if needed?)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Remember: <em>The best streaming framework is the one that solves your problem without creating new ones.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes that's Flink. Sometimes that's Spark. Sometimes it's neither, and you should use Kafka Streams or even plain old batch processing with a good scheduler.
