        <div class="blog-content">
            <p>
                When I joined 6sense in early 2022, our B2B intelligence platform was processing data using Spark batch jobs. We'd run scheduled batch transformations throughout the day, aggregating events and updating downstream systems. It worked. But we had a critical problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Stateful data processing across batch runs was becoming increasingly complex.</strong> We needed to maintain session state, user journey tracking, and complex event patterns across multiple batch runs. Spark's approach of processing data in complete batches meant we had to implement complex state management ourselves, leading to brittle and error-prone systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                We needed a framework that could handle stateful stream processing natively, maintain state across deployments, and provide exactly-once semantics. That's when we made the switch to Apache Flink. Today, we process data with complex state management that would be nearly impossible with traditional batch processing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's what I learned making that transition, and how to decide which tool is right for your use case.
            </p>

            <h2>The Real Difference (It's Not What You Think)</h2>

            <p>
                Most articles will tell you "Flink is true streaming, Spark is micro-batching." That's technically true, but it misses the point. The real question is: <em>What does that difference mean for your actual use case?</em>
            </p>

            <h3>Spark Batch: The Foundation</h3>

            <p>
                Spark batch processing is powerful. You write transformations, execute them on massive datasets, and get results. Simple, reliable, battle-tested.
            </p>

            <p>
                At 6sense, we were using Spark batch for:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Daily data aggregation and reporting (every 24 hours)</li>
                <li>Complex business logic that required full dataset context</li>
                <li>Historical data processing and analytics</li>
                <li>Generating insights for business intelligence dashboards</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                It worked well for basic processing. But as our requirements evolved, pain points emerged around stateful processing.
            </p>

            <h3>The Stateful Processing Problem</h3>

            <p>
                Our biggest challenge was <strong>maintaining state across batch runs</strong>:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Session state management</strong>: Tracking user sessions across multiple batch runs was complex and error-prone</li>
                <li><strong>Event pattern detection</strong>: Complex event processing required maintaining state between batches</li>
                <li><strong>Data consistency</strong>: Ensuring state consistency when batch processing failed or was interrupted</li>
                <li><strong>State recovery</strong>: Rebuilding state after failures required complex checkpoint and recovery logic</li>
                <li><strong>Deployment challenges</strong>: Any code changes required careful state migration planning</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>The Breaking Point:</strong> We wanted to implement real-time user journey tracking and anomaly detection. With daily batch intervals, we'd lose critical state information. Plus, maintaining complex state across batch boundaries was becoming a maintenance nightmare. We needed a better approach for stateful processing.
            </div>

            <h2>Enter Apache Flink</h2>

            <p>
                Flink is built from the ground up for stream processing. Not batching disguised as streaming—actual event-by-event processing.
            </p>

            <h3>What Made Flink Different</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>1. True Event Time Processing</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Flink's event time handling is phenomenal. We could process late-arriving events correctly without complex workarounds. Watermarks gave us precise control over when to trigger computations.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>2. State Management</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Flink's state management is a game-changer. We maintain billions of state entries (tracking user sessions, intent signals, etc.) with minimal overhead. The state backend options (RocksDB for large state, heap for fast access) give you real flexibility.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>3. Exactly-Once Semantics</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Flink's two-phase commit protocol ensures exactly-once processing even across multiple sinks. No more worrying about duplicate events in downstream systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>4. Backpressure Handling</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                When downstream systems slow down, Flink's automatic backpressure prevents data loss and reduces the need for over-provisioning.
            </p>

            <h2>The Migration Journey</h2>

            <p>
                Migrating from Spark to Flink wasn't trivial. Here's what we learned:
            </p>

            <h3>Week 1-2: Learning Curve</h3>

            <p>
                Flink's API is different. If you're coming from Spark, expect an adjustment period. The DataStream API takes a different approach than Spark's DataFrame API.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Start with Flink's Table API if you're comfortable with SQL. It's similar to Spark SQL and easier to learn.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 3-4: State Management Strategy</h3>

            <p>
                This is where Flink shines but also where it gets complex. We had to rethink how we manage state:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Which state backend to use? (We went with RocksDB for large state)</li>
                <li>How to partition state effectively?</li>
                <li>What's our checkpoint interval? (We settled on 30 seconds)</li>
                <li>How to handle state schema evolution?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 5-6: Performance Tuning</h3>

            <p>
                Flink requires different tuning than Spark:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parallelism</strong>: We used 120 parallel instances for our main jobs</li>
                <li><strong>Network buffers</strong>: Increased to handle high throughput</li>
                <li><strong>Managed memory</strong>: Tuned for RocksDB state backend</li>
                <li><strong>Checkpointing</strong>: Found the sweet spot between frequency and overhead</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Use Spark Streaming</h2>

            <p>
                Don't get me wrong—Spark Streaming is still an excellent choice for many scenarios:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your latency SLA is 5+ seconds</strong>: No need for the complexity of Flink</li>
                <li><strong>You already use Spark for batch</strong>: Code reuse and unified architecture are valuable</li>
                <li><strong>Simple transformations and aggregations</strong>: Spark's SQL-like API makes this easy</li>
                <li><strong>Team expertise</strong>: If your team knows Spark well, the productivity gain matters</li>
                <li><strong>Integration requirements</strong>: Spark's ecosystem is bigger—more connectors, more libraries</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Use Flink</h2>

            <p>
                We chose Flink because:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sub-second latency requirements</strong>: Real-time matters for our use case</li>
                <li><strong>Complex stateful computations</strong>: User session tracking, pattern detection, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>High throughput with low latency</strong>: We need both, not one or the other</li>
                <li><strong>Event time processing</strong>: Handling out-of-order events correctly is critical</li>
                <li><strong>Complex event processing</strong>: Pattern matching and sequence detection</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Results at 6sense</h2>

            <p>
                After migrating from Spark batch to Flink for stateful processing:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Simplified session state management across time windows</li>
                <li>Enabled real-time user journey tracking with persistent state</li>
                <li>Implemented complex event pattern detection that maintains state across events</li>
                <li>Reduced state recovery complexity from days of development to hours</li>
                <li>Eliminated state consistency issues during deployments</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                But it wasn't all wins. We also:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Spent 6 weeks on the migration and learning curve</li>
                <li>Had to build custom monitoring and alerting for Flink-specific metrics</li>
                <li>Invested in training the team on Flink's concepts</li>
                <li>Dealt with a smaller community and fewer Stack Overflow answers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Recommendation</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Start with Spark Batch if:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your processing is primarily historical data analysis</li>
                <li>You don't need to maintain state across processing runs</li>
                <li>You already have Spark expertise in your team</li>
                <li>State consistency across deployments isn't a major concern</li>
                <li>Your data processing is primarily schedule-based (daily, weekly)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Choose Flink Streaming if:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>You need persistent state management across time windows</li>
                <li>You want zero-downtime deployments with stateful processing</li>
                <li>You're doing complex event pattern detection</li>
                <li>You need exactly-once processing semantics</li>
                <li>You're willing to invest in learning a new framework</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>The Truth:</strong> Both tools are excellent. Flink isn't "better" than Spark Streaming—it's different. The question isn't which is superior, but which better matches your requirements, constraints, and team capabilities.
            </div>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

            <p>
                The move to Flink was the right choice for 6sense. But it wasn't an easy choice, and it wasn't cheap in terms of time and effort.
            </p>

            <p>
                If I were starting a new streaming project today, I'd ask myself:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>What's my actual latency requirement? (Be honest—do you really need sub-second?)</li>
                <li>How complex is my state management?</li>
                <li>What does my team already know?</li>
                <li>What's the cost of being wrong? (Can I migrate later if needed?)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Remember: <em>The best streaming framework is the one that solves your problem without creating new ones.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes that's Flink. Sometimes that's Spark. Sometimes it's neither, and you should use Kafka Streams or even plain old batch processing with a good scheduler.
